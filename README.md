This project aims to create a "Single page application" for bikes rental of the city of our choice, mainly based on JavaScript

In this single page, the user accesses to a slider, then a map of the city with a booking form.

The slider has to be created by our own with:
	- an automatic sliding each 5 secondes
	- the possibility to stop it, restart it and sliding it to the left or to the right
	- the ability of sliding to the left or to the right can be done with a mouse click or keyboard left and right arrows

The map must contains all following parts:
	- use an api to display the map and markers
	- a booking form with some details of selected marker
	- use canvas to validate the form

When form is validated, a success message has to be show under the map with a timer.
Same as the slider, this timer must be created by our own. Iy has to start at 20min and decrease until 0min.
